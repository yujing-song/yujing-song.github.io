I am an associate researcher (Principal Investigator) at the Institute of Advanced Agricultural Sciences, Peking University. I apply modeling and quantitative methods to study markets with primary focuses on agricultural, food, and resource markets. I obtained my PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from University of California, Davis under the supervision of [Richard J. Sexton](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/richard-sexton/) (co-chair), [Rachael E. Goodhue (co-chair)](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/rachael-goodhue/) (co-chair), and [Dalia Ghanem (co-chair)](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/dalia-ghanem/).
