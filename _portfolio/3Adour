title: "Structure and Power in Multilateral Negotiations: An Application to French Water Policy (with coauthors)"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "We investigate the relationship between negotiation structure and stakeholder effectiveness in policymaking, focusing on water management in the Adour Basin, France. Using the Rausser-Simon model, we analyze the impact of negotiation design on the bargaining power of farmer stakeholder groups. Our experiments reveal nuanced dynamics: while reducing individual access may benefit coalition members with strategic advantage, restrictions on bargaining proposals may sometimes undermine coalition effectiveness. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between negotiation structure and stakeholder power. [download](http://yujing-song.github.io/files/Adour.pdf)"
