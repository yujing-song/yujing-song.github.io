title: "Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership's Influence on Agricultural Value Chain Participation: Insights from Global Trade Analysis Project Model Simulation"
collection: portfolio
excerpt: "The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) forms the world's largest free trade area, significantly impacting international agricultural trade. Existing studies focus on RCEP's effect on agricultural trade value, but its impact on agricultural value chain participation remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model with dynamic recursive updates, tariff commitment scenarios, and a global value chain accounting framework. We construct indices for regional and global value chain participation and positions to examine RCEP's effects on member countries' agricultural value chains. Our findings suggest that RCEP will enhance value chain participation and improve the agricultural value chain positions of China, South Korea, and Australia. This research provides a value chain perspective and strategic insights for leveraging RCEP for high-quality agricultural economic development."
