title: "Vertical Contracts and Rival Entry: Evidence from the US Yogurt Industry"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/Yogurt
excerpt: "Manufacturers often form formal and informal vertical contracts with retailers, enabling them to influence retail prices and product assortment. In particular, the contracts may empower incumbents to effectively counter a rival’s attempts to enter the retailer. Using scanner data on the US yogurt market, our empirical evidence suggests that incumbent and dominant yogurt manufacturers strategically deter the entry of an innovating rival, Chobani, which popularized Greek yogurt, likely via vertical contracts with retailers. We estimate a structural model of demand and manufacturer-retailer pricing and as- sortment. Vertical contracts with an incumbent manufacturer create a trade-off for retailers given limited shelf space: obtaining vertical transfers from incumbents versus capturing potential profits from adding rival’s products. Counterfactual analysis shows that at least 20% retail chains keep an incumbent brand in exchange for Chobani products to obtain more profits, implying distorted assortment due to vertical contracts and losses in consumer surplus.
