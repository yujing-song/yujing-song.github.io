We study adaptation via relational contracting alongside active spot trading. Employing unique and rich transaction data from a large wholesale vegetable market, we show that (i) facing stochastic supply and competition, buyers pay a price premium to relational sellers in exchange for relational contracts (RCs) that provide sup- ply assurance; (ii) RCs are more likely to be formed in the presence of more competing buyers given the number of sellers and aggre- gate supply; and (iii) relational traders adjust contractual terms after the realization of supply shocks, contributing novel empirical evidence on relational adaptation by non-integrated traders.
